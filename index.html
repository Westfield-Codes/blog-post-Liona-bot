  <h3>My Experience</h3>
  <p>When I went to Myrtle Beach in South Carolina I remember getting such a bad sunburn just because I didn’t put enough sunscreen on. My face was the worst out of the bunch, it had blisters on it and it was hard to sleep or things touching my face in general</p>
  <p>I had to stay in the hotel room for a whole day because I couldn't be out in the sun or it would get worse so I wasted a whole day of activities just locked up inside. I wish that I did put enough sunscreen on so I could go and enjoy the beach with my family but alas things don’t always go according to plan. That's why you should invest in some good sunscreen, and also someone to tell you when to put it on but that's your problem.</p>
  
  <h3>Why is this interesting?</h3>
  <p>People in their life experience at least one sunburn experience, unless you’ve been living under a rock. More people can relate to this than if it was an experience like being to Antarctica. And people can share their experiences about how bad or how annoying it was to them. Here you can comment on how your plot experience went with sunburns.</p>
  
  <h3>Specific Weather Conditions You Should Know About</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You can check the UV index.</li>
    <li>It goes 0-11+ the higher number the more likely you’ll get burned.</li>
    <li>If it's 10 or higher it might just be better to stay inside till it cools down.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Here are some ways to prevent this outcome</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Number 1 way is to not go in the sun at all, just stay at home!</li>
    <li>Whenever the UV Index is high you should seek some shade to hide away from the heat.</li>
    <li>Apply a good amount of sunscreen when going outside even if it’s only for 2 hours or so.</li>
  </ul>
